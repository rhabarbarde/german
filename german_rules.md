1. **Capitalizing Nouns**: In German, all nouns are capitalized.
   - **Example**: Der Hund, Die Katze, Das Haus.
   - **Explanation**:  If it's a person, place, thing, or idea, it gets a capital letter. This helps to identify nouns within a sentence.
<br/>
2. **Verb Placement**: The action word usually comes second. The conjugated verb is typically the second element in a German main clause.
   - **Example**: Ich esse einen Apfel (I am eating an apple).
   - **Explanation**: No matter how long the sentence is, the verb (like 'read') usually comes in second place. 'Esse' (eat) is the second element, following the subject 'Ich' (I).
<br/>
3. **Sentence Structure**: German follows a Subject-Verb-Object structure in main clauses.
   - **Example**: Der Junge spielt Fußball (The boy plays soccer).
   - **Explanation**: The subject is 'Der Junge', the verb is 'spielt', and 'Fußball' is the object.
<br/>
4. **Negation with 'Nicht' and 'Kein'**: Use 'nicht' to negate verbs and adjectives, and 'kein' to negate nouns.
    - **Example**: Ich bin nicht müde (I am not tired). Ich habe kein Geld (I have no money).
    - **Explanation**: 'Nicht' negates the adjective 'müde' (tired), and 'kein' replaces the indefinite article to negate 'Geld' (money).
<br/>
5. **Questions Start with Verbs**: When asking something, start with the action word.
   - **Example**: "Can you help me?" becomes "Kannst du mir helfen?"
   - **Explanation**: The action word ('Can' or 'Kannst') comes first in a question.
<br/>
6. **Verbs at the End in Past Tense**: In past tense sentences, the main action word goes at the end.
   - **Example**: "I have read the book" becomes "Ich habe das Buch gelesen".
   - **Explanation**: When talking about something that happened in the past, the main verb (like 'read') goes last.
<br/>
7.  **'Es gibt' for 'There is/There are'**: Used to express the existence of something.
    - **Example**: "Es gibt einen Hund im Garten."
    - **Explanation**: 'Es gibt' is a fixed expression equivalent to 'there is' or 'there are.'
<br/>
8. **'Zu' with Doing Words in Some Sentences**: 'Zu' is used before verbs in certain sentence types.
    - **Example**: "I hope to see you soon" → "Ich hoffe, dich bald zu sehen."
    - **Explanation**: 'Zu' precedes the verb in sentences expressing hopes or plans.
<br/>
9. **Reflexive Verbs Aren't Always Reflexive**: Some verbs have different reflexive uses than in English.
    - **Example**:  "I remember" is just "Ich erinnere mich" (I remember myself).
    - **Explanation**: In German, some actions that reflect back on the subject use reflexive pronouns like 'mich'.
<br/>
10. **'Haben' and 'Sein' in Perfect Tense**: Used to form most past tense sentences.
    - **Example**: "I have eaten" → "Ich habe gegessen"; "I have gone" → "Ich bin gegangen".
    - **Explanation**: 'Haben' and 'sein' are helpers for forming past tense.
